   <h3>CIS 301: Logical Foundations of Programming, Fall 2015</h3>

.. include:: def.rst

----

Objective and Topics
********************

We will learn how circuits and software are founded on symbolic logic, and
we will see how every computer program contains a "logical skeleton" (like a
electronic circuit's schematic) that forecasts the program's computation.
We can use the logical skeleton as a mathematical proof of the program's 
correctness, just like you do in algebra or circuit-theory class.
We will also study symbolic logic itself -- what it looks like, what it means,
and how to manipulate it within formal proofs.
As time allows, we will learn useful programming techniques (that you are
unlikely to see elsewhere) based on grammars, dynamic data structures, and
logic programming.

Here is a summary of the topics covered; these are listed in the order that
they will be covered from the course lecture notes:

1. boolean operators and truth tables for analyzing simple circuits; 
   equations as a circuit-design language; algebraic laws for equational systems
   
2. deduction laws for imperative assignment; laws for conditional (if) commands;
   deducing logical properties of imperative programs
   
3. logical properties of functions and procedures: pre- and post-conditions;
   global-variable invariants; invariants for functions that are recursively
   defined (call themselves)
   
4. deduction law for while-loops; loop invariants; 
   simple examples of quantification
   
5. propositional symbolic logic in natural-deduction format;
   tactics for applying deduction laws;
   introduction to soundness and completeness;
   normal forms and resolution theorem proving
   
6. logical laws for the quantifiers and their application to programs that
   manipulate data structures
   
7. first-order unification and resolution theorem proving;
   logic programming in Prolog
   
8. semantics of recursively defined data structures (e.g., trees) and
   the functions that process them; grammars and parsing; mathematical induction

Grading
*******

* Homework: 25%

* Exam 1: 20%

* Exam 2: 20%

* Final Exam: 25%

* Class participation: 10%

Class participation involves not just being physically present, but also
actively contributing to the learning climate, by answering questions,
doing simple exercises on the board, asking interesting questions, etc.

Final letter grades are assigned based on the following scale:
90% to earn an A, and 80% to earn a B; 70% to earn a C, and 60% to earn a D.


Homeworks
*********
Homeworks are due almost every week and are to be submitted through
K-State Online.
Assignments that are late will not be graded, unless in case of documented
medical or family emergencies.


Exams
*****
Exams will be closed-book and closed notes.
The final will be comprehensive, but with emphasis on the latter part of the
course.


Grievances
**********
If you think the instructor or the TAs have made an error when grading your test
or your homework, you are of course very welcome to ask for clarification.
But complaints about judgment calls, like how much credit to give for
a partially correct solution, are not encouraged (it is like arguing balls and
strikes).


Attendance Policy
*****************

In general, there will be NO make-up exams and class exercises!
Special consideration will be given in only exceptional circumstances.
Exceptional circumstances are generally limited to:

* Emergencies: death in student's immediate family, or 
  near-death experience of the student.

* Non-emergencies: certified excused absences for official university activities.

If you believe you qualify for exceptional treatment, you must notify the
instructor prior to the date of the exam or exercise to be missed.


Statement Regarding Academic Honesty
************************************

Kansas State University has an Honor System based on personal integrity, which 
is presumed to be sufficient assurance in academic matters one's work is
performed honestly and without unauthorized assistance. 
Undergraduate and graduate students, by registration, acknowledge the
jurisdiction of the Honor System.
The policies and procedures of the Honor System apply to all full and part-time
students enrolled in undergraduate and graduate courses on-campus, off-campus,
and via distance learning.
The honor system website can be reach via the following URL: 
http://www.ksu.edu/honor.

A component vital to the Honor System is the inclusion of the Honor Pledge which
applies to all assignments, examinations, or other course work undertaken by
students.
The Honor Pledge is implied, whether or not it is stated:
"On my honor, as a student, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid
on this academic work."
A grade of XF can result from a breach of academic honesty.
The F indicates failure in the course; the X indicates the reason is an Honor
Pledge violation.


Other Administrative Issues
***************************

* **Incompletenes:** An incomplete (I) final grade will be given only by prior
  arrangement in exceptional circumstances conforming to departmental policy in
  which the bulk of course work has been completed in passing fashion.

* **Drop Policy:** It is your responsibility to drop the course if you are
  enrolled but decide not to complete the course --- there are no "automatic"
  drops due to nonattendance.
  The University allows a retake of a course with removal of the prior grade,
  at most once per course, for a maximum of five courses.
  
* **Students with Disabilities:** If you have any physical or learning
  disability which will make it difficult for you to carry out the work as
  I have outlined in this syllabus or which will require academic
  accommodations, please notify me the first two weeks of the course.

* **Harrassment:** One purpose of your education is to help you develop skills,
  approaches, and abilities that are necessary for effective teamwork, and for
  your success in your profession and as a citizen.
  It is important that you understand your rights and responsibilities regarding
  the University's Sexual and Racial Harassment policies (full text of the
  policies can be found on KSU's web site at
  http://www.ksu.edu/uauc/fhbook/fhxj.html).
  If you experience any situations, in or out of class, that seem inappropriate
  or that make you uncomfortable, a list of resources and courses of action to
  assist you can be found on the College of Engineering web site at
  http://www.engg.ksu.edu/harassment-statement.

* **Expectations for Classroom Conduct:** All student activities in the
  University, including this course, are governed by the Student Judicial
  Conduct Code as outlined in the Student Government Association By Laws,
  Article VI, Section 3, number 2.
  Students that engage in behavior that disrupts the learning environment may be
  asked to leave the class.

* **Campus Safety:** Kansas State University is committed to providing a safe
  teaching and learning environment for student and faculty members.
  In order to enhance your safety in the unlikely case of a campus emergency
  make sure that you know where and how to quickly exit your classroom and how
  to follow any emergency directives.
  To view additional campus emergency information go to the University's main
  page, http://www.k-state.edu, and click on the Emergency Information button.

* **Copyright Issues:** Class and lecture notes for this course carry a
  copyright.
  Students are prohibited from selling (or being paid for taking) notes during
  this course to or by any person or commercial firm without the express written
  permission of the professor teaching this course.

For a more complete discussion of these issues see the course policies for the
College of Engineering at Kansas State University:
